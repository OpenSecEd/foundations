*Summary:* In this learning session we will cover the foundations of
security. By this we mean what security is all about, what types of
properties we are interested in and what we want to achieve in our
security work.

*Intended learning outcomes:* After this session you should be able:

-   to *understand* the what security is generally about.

*Reading:* You should read Gollmann’s chapter on “Foundations of
Computer Security” (Gollmann 2011 Chap. 3). There he attempts at a
definition of Computer Security and related terms, confidentiality,
integrity, and availability, which we need for our treatment of the
topic. Anderson also covers this in Chapter 1 of (Anderson 2008). He
also treats a wider area than just *computer* security, which is good
for us, he covers many aspects of security in different examples.
