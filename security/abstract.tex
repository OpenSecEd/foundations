% What's the problem?
% Why is it a problem? Research gap left by other approaches?
% Why is it important? Why care?
% What's the approach? How to solve the problem?
% What's the findings? How was it evaluated, what are the results, limitations, 
% what remains to be done?

% XXX Summary
\emph{Summary:}
In this learning session we will cover the foundations of security.
By this we mean what security is all about, \eg what types of properties we are 
interested in and what we want to achieve in our security work.

% XXX Motivation and intended learning outcomes
\emph{Intended learning outcomes:}
After this session you should be able:
\begin{itemize}
  \item to \emph{understand} the what security is generally about.
\end{itemize}

% XXX Prerequisites
%\emph{Prerequisites:}
%\dots

% XXX Reading material
\emph{Reading:}
You should read
\begin{itemize}
  \item Chapter 3, \enquote{Foundations of Computer Security} 
    of~\cite{Gollmann2011cs}.
    There Gollmann attempts at a definition of Computer Security and related 
    terms, \eg confidentiality, integrity, and availability, which we need for 
    our treatment of the topic.
  \item Chapter 1 of~\cite{Anderson2008sea}.
    Anderson treats a wider area than just \emph{computer} security, which is 
    good for us, he covers many aspects of security in different examples.
\end{itemize}
