% XXX Summary
\emph{Summary:}
In this learning session we will cover the foundations of security.
By this we mean what security is all about, \eg what types of properties we are 
interested in and what we want to achieve in our security work.

% XXX Motivation and intended learning outcomes
\emph{Intended learning outcomes:}
After this session you should be able:
\begin{itemize}
  \item to \emph{understand} the what security is generally about.
\end{itemize}

% XXX Reading material
\emph{Reading:}
You should read Gollmann's chapter on \enquote{Foundations of Computer 
  Security}~\cite[Chap.\ 3]{Gollmann2011cs}.
There he attempts at a definition of Computer Security and related terms, \eg 
confidentiality, integrity, and availability, which we need for our treatment of 
the topic.
Anderson also covers this in Chapter 1 of~\cite{Anderson2008sea}.
He also treats a wider area than just \emph{computer} security, which is good 
for us, he covers many aspects of security in different examples.
