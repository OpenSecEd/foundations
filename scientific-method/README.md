[![The scientific 
method](https://youtu.be/tBzOSxQbWbI)](https://img.youtube.com/vi/tBzOSxQbWbI/hqdefault.jpg)

*Summary:* In this learning session we will give an introduction to the
scientific method and particularly how this can be applied in the area
of security.

*Intended learning outcomes:* After this session you should be able:

-   to *differentiate* which types of scientific methods are appropriate
    to answer a given question.

*Reading:* You should read  (Peisert and Bishop 2007). This paper
discusses the scientific method of (parts of) the security field. For a
more in-depth reflection on the state of security as a scientific
pursuit, we recommend  (Herley and Oorschot 2017).
