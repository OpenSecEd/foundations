% XXX Summary
\emph{Summary:}
In this learning session we will give an introduction to the scientific method 
and particularly how this can be applied in the area of security.

% XXX Motivation and intended learning outcomes
\emph{Intended learning outcomes:}
After this session you should be able:
\begin{itemize}
  \item to \emph{differentiate} which types of scientific methods are 
    appropriate to answer a given question.
\end{itemize}

% XXX Prerequisites
%\emph{Prerequisites:}
%\dots

% XXX Reading material
\emph{Reading:}
You should read 
\begin{itemize}
  \item 
    \citetitle{HowToDesignSecurityExperiments}~\cite{HowToDesignSecurityExperiments}, 
    this paper discusses the scientific method of (parts of) the security 
    field.
  \item \citetitle{SecurityAsAScience}~\cite{SecurityAsAScience}, for a more 
    both wider and more in-depth reflection on the state of security as a 
    scientific pursuit.
\end{itemize}
