  title={SoK: Science, Security and the Elusive Goal of Security as a Scientific

  pages={99-120},
  abstract={The past ten years has seen increasing calls to make security 
    research more “scientific”. On the surface, most agree that this is 
        desirable, given universal recognition of “science” as a positive force. 
        However, we find that there is little clarity on what “scientific” means 
        in the context of computer security research, or consensus on what a 
        “Science of Security” should look like. We selectively review work in 
        the history and philosophy of science and more recent work under the 
        label “Science of Security”. We explore what has been done under the 
        theme of relating science and security, put this in context with 
        historical science, and offer observations and insights we hope may 
        motivate further exploration and guidance. Among our findings are that 
        practices on which the rest of science has reached consensus appear 
        little used or recognized in security, and a pattern of methodological 
        errors continues unaddressed.},
